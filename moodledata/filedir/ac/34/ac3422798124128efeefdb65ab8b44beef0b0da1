<p>In this part of the writing exam students have a choice of tasks (writing an article, an essay, a letter, a report, a review or a story). In order to do this you must be aware of the different structure and characteristics of these types of texts.</p>
<p><b>1. Letter</b></p>
<p>The structure of a letter is quite similar to that of the e-mail we have seen before. Students will have to write a letter to answer a situation given in an appropriate register and tone. The target reader could be a colleague, an employer or an editor.</p>
<p>Remember that the first paragraph should be short and state the purpose of the letter: to make an enquiry, complain, request something, etc.</p>
<p>The paragraph or paragraphs in the middle of the letter should contain the relevant information behind the writing of the letter. Most letters in English are not very long, so keep the information to the essentials and concentrate on organising it in a clear and logical manner rather than expanding too much.</p>
<p>Save the last paragraph to state what action you expect the recipient to take: to send you information, etc.</p>
<p><b>2. Report</b></p>
<p>A report is a formal text that gives you information about a subject that you are interested in and would like to know more about. It is different from a recount or an explanation text because it isn't written in the order that things happen.</p>
<p>It is usually written for a superior or a group. Students will be expected to give factual information and make suggestions or recommendations. It will have to be clearly organized and may include headings.</p>
<p>If you choose this option you may need some of the following sentences.</p>
<p>Phrases to start the report:</p>
<ul>
<li>The aim of this report is…</li>
<li>The purpose of this report is…</li>
</ul>
<p>Phrases to make suggestions or recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>I recommend that…</li>
<li>I would recommend…</li>
<li>I suggest…</li>
<li>I suggest that…</li>
<li>It would be a good idea…</li>
</ul>
<p><b>3. Story</b></p>
<p>Students could be asked to write a short story for a magazine or a website. The main purpose must be to catch the reader’s interest and show the student’s knowledge of the narrative tenses. The storyline should be clear and coherent and it has to link with the prompt sentence.</p>
<p>In order to do this, students need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a range of verb tenses</li>
<li>Use different time conjunctions and adverbs</li>
<li>Maybe use direct speech to make the story more immediate.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>4. Review</b></p>
<p>Students will have to write a review usually for a magazine, newspaper or website. The purpose of this type of text is to describe something that the writer has experienced and give his/ her opinion about it (a film, a book, a restaurant…). The text should give a clear idea of what the product is like and description is the key for this kind of text. It usually includes a recommendation for the reader.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In order to do this, students will have to</p>
<p>- Give the review a title</p>
<p>- Use a lot of adjectives to describe the item and your feelings about it</p>
<p>- Use sentences for praising like: “I think everyone will enjoy this” or “This … is really worth…”</p>
<p><b>5. Article</b></p>
<p>The article will be written will usually be written for a magazine or newsletter. The aim is to interest the reader, so students should include some opinion or comment. It is advisable to use descriptions, a wide range of vocabulary, a personal point of view and a catchy title. Also it’s possible to add direct or indirect questions.</p>
<p>In order to do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before writing, identify who will read the article.</li>
<li>You can identify the readers by looking at the type of newspaper or magazine you are writing for.</li>
<li>Write things you think your readers will find interesting.</li>
<li>Before you write the article make a plan</li>
<li>In your plan decide what you will put in each paragraph</li>
<li>Make sure that the plan answers the question</li>
<li>Write the article following your plan</li>
<li>While you are writing think about the effect on your readers.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>6. Essay</b></p>
<p>Students will be required to write an essay for a teacher. It should be well organized and structured:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Development</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ul>
<p>The main objective is to develop a discussion of issues surrounding a certain topic. Students will have to give reasons to support their opinions.</p>
<p>You can agree or disagree with the statement of the exercise or discuss both options.</p>
<p>It’s important planning the text carefully and paying attention to the opening and closing paragraphs.</p>
<p>In order to structure the different points you deal with, try to use some of these words:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly</li>
<li>Secondly</li>
<li>Finally</li>
<li>Also</li>
<li>What is more</li>
<li>Subsequently</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, you will need a few sentences to express opinion:</p>
<ul>
<li>In my opinion</li>
<li>I feel</li>
<li>I believe</li>
<li>I think</li>
</ul>
